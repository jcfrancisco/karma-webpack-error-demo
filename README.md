# karma-webpack-error-demo

To reproduce this, pull down this repo, `npm install`, then run `gulp test`.

Conditions to reproduce:

0. You must be running Karma through gulp 4.0.
1. There must be more than one spec file being run by Karma.
2. One or more of these spec files must have either a syntax error, or an import statement that resolves to a nonexistent file.

You should see an error message (generated by the syntax error in
`spec/has_syntax_error.js`) that does not point to where the syntax error is.
